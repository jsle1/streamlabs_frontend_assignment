`Why did I name my project folder "lemon_app"?`
  Well, since this is not the real Melon App. It's melon mispelled, which makes `lemon`.

`How long did it take you to complete this assignment?`
Technically, I did not complete this assignment. However, I worked on it for about 3 days. 

I want to say what I completed was unforunately not too much either.. I mainly only got the "Add Media Sources" down. I was unable to get to the resizing of the images on the screen. 

`What about this assignment did you find most challenging?`
I think the decisions I made through this process. I decided to try Vue 3 and use a UI library called Ant Design. Which I wasn't familiar in both because I'm more use to Vue 2 and Sematic UI library. 

`What about this assignment did you find unclear?`
I think have a "camera" photo and asking for us to get familiar with the media stream API. So, it was a little unclear if the our code should implement a camera stream or if it should just be the camera photo. 

`What challenges did you face that you did not expect?`
- I think the difficulty of using the UI library. I didn't think it would be too complex, but after testing around there was a bit of difficulty using it. 

- For some reason, the icons I tried to used weren't working as well. I tried to use Ant's Icons and Font Awesome, but it seemed to be a dependency issues.  

- I didn't realize in Vue 3 that instead of using `document` that it uses `ref`. Which explains why the livestream camera footage I was trying to implement wasn't appearing on the screen. I know my method was behaving correctly because I watched my camera turn on, but no feed was appearing. I spent a good time trying to figure out why my livestreaming camera wasn't working. 

- The difference between Vue 2 and Vue 3. I didn't think it would be too difficult, but I did experience moments that I realized maybe I should have taken more time understanding the differences when developing.

`Do you feel like this assignment has an appropriate level of difficulty?`
Honestly, yes. I feel like this assignment perfect fits into what your company would be looking for. Even though, I did not reach where I wanted to be with this assignment or completed it the way you asked, I feel like it is a really good assessment of one's skills based on what your company does.  

`Briefly explain your decisions to use tools, frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, etc.`
I used Vue because it's honesly one of my favorite frameworks because it's clean and clear to understand. I knwo that sentence sounds very contradicting as that my main challenge was learning Vue as well. But, out of the frameworks I've worked with, it is still the clearest to me. 

I used Ant Design for Vue because I wanted to use a UI library that looked clean and worked with Vue 3. However, I quickly discovered that this library is very React focused which isn't bad but some behaviors were kinda new to me. I think if I was to do it again, I would do it with a different UI library or created my own custom elements.

`Did you make certain assumptions and decisions around the UI/UX? Please elaborate on your reasonings.`
I did focus on the UX/UI aspect because my goal was to ensure the main components worked first then making it look nice after I had the logic down. Unforunately I did not get there yet. 

However, comments of the wireframe itself I was planning on changing was the "Add Source" title on the left-hand side. I thought it was a button at first since it's the same color and look as the "Go Live" button. Thus in the redesign I planned on making it more of a smaller title. 

I wanted to have the "Chat, Record, and Go Live" buttons with icons and aligned with the streaming screen as it would make the page feel cleaner.

`Lessons Learned`
To be honest, I learned a lot from this assignement despite me not completing. I've learned that I still have a lot to learn, and my skills aren't really where they should be in my opinion. It kinda showed me that my current job isn't really giving me room to grow too much. 

`Things I would change?`
I would have made the modal and other aspects of the page utilize components more. Also, just creating the elements instead of a UI library.  

`Final Notes`
Thank you for taking the time to let me do this coding assignement and being considered for the position at Streamlabs. As someone who has used your application before, I was really excited when you reached out to interview for your company. I am truely greatful for this experience. Even if my skills may not be where they should be for this role, I would definitely like to be in touch in the future. 

Highlight of my week, even though I didn't complete it the way I wanted it to be done.
